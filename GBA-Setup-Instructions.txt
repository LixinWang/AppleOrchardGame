Instructions
 WINDOWS (a zip with the following software is attached)
	1. Install Cygwin (provided) to "C:\cygwin" (recommended version) or "C:\cygwin64" (to the default location)
		Open the setup-x86 (or x86_64)
		Click next
		Choose install from internet and click next
		Choose the default directory and click next
		Click next again
		Choose direct connection and click next
		Choose http://cygwin.mirror.constant.com and click next
		In the search bar, type gcc-core
		Click the little plus symbol next to Devel
		Under the New section, click the Skip next to gcc-core (to make it not skip)
		Go back to the search bar and repeat the process for: gcc-g++, gdb, make
	The full name of the components are:
 		gcc-core: Compiler
		gcc-g++: C++ Compiler
		gdb: The GNU Debugger
		make: The GNU version of the 'make' utility
	Click next when all those are selected
	Wait for installation
	Click finish (without shortcuts)
    	Add 'C:\cygwin\bin' to the Windows Path Environment Variables*
     	*Control Panel -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Advanced Tab -> Environment Systems -> Edit the "Path" in System Variables and add the Cygwin directory.
 
	2. Install (extract) devkitARM (provided) to "C:\devkitARM" (by default)
		Extract the provided archive (do not use a downloaded installer on Windows)
 
	3. Install (extract) VisualBoyAdvance (provided) to "C:\vba" (by default)
		Download/Extract one of the latest versions
		The executable should be in C:\vba (or a directory of your choice)	
	
	4. Use your Explorer to determine exactly where the system utilities you just obtained are located.  
		You must know where the following are on your hard drive.
		  devkitARM/bin (default: “C:/devkitARM/bin”)
		  cygwin/bin (default: “C:/cygwin/bin”)
		  VisualBoyAdvance.exe (default: “C:/vba/VisualBoyAdvance.exe”)

	5. Edit your Makefile located in your sample project to include the paths in the indicated locations:
		DKPATH = Path to devkitARM bin directory
		CCPATH = Path to gcc bin directory
		VBASIM = Path to vba.exe
	
	6. Edit your Makefile to include your main.c source.
		This is where you will list all source files you may include in the future.
		SOURCES = main.c

	7. Go down to sumblime instructions


MAC	
	1. Make sure you have XCode Tools installed, or the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) from your Linux distribution's software tool. To check	this, open "Terminal" (Applications > Utilities or Applications > Accessories, or you can search for it by pressing Command+Spacebar) and type "gcc" then press enter. You should see the following:
 
          lawn-128-61-53-109:~ YourName$ gcc
          clang: error: no input files

	Then try typing "make" and pressing enter. You should see the following:

          lawn-128-61-53-109:~ YourName$ make
          make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.

 
	If you see "command not found" you need to obtain XCode Command Line tools or reinstall GCC and Make. Sometimes Terminal will automatically ask you to install the Command Line tools, and if it does just follow the instructions to do so. If it does not ask you to install the Command Line tools, type: "xcode-select --install" and press enter.
 
	2. Install devkitARM to "/opt/devkitARM" (by default) (You can also install it wherever you want to, as long as its a directory that won't change)
		Make sure you choose the option that says 'OSX'
		https://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitARM/devkitARM_r45/
 
	3a. Install VisualBoyAdvanced
         Download the zipped folder at this location: VisualBoyAdvanced.zip
         Move the .app file inside the .zip file to somewhere you can access it easily

	3b. If VisualBoyAdvanced doesn't work for you, use Boycott Advanced: http://www.bannister.org/software/ba.htm
 
	4. Use your Finder to determine exactly where the system utilities you just obtained are located.  
		You must know where the following are on your hard drive.
		  devkitARM/bin (default: “/opt/devkitARM/bin”)
		  cygwin/bin (default: “/usr/bin”)
		  Boycott Advance (default: “/usr/bin/open”)
		Edit your Makefile to include the paths in the indicated locations:
		DKPATH = Path to devkitARM bin directory
		CCPATH = Path to gcc bin directory
		VBASIM = Path to "/usr/bin/open" by default
	
	5. Edit your Makefile to include your main.c source.
		This is where you will list all source files you may include in the future.
		SOURCES = main.c

General:
You can now build and run GBA projects using Command Prompt/Terminal.  A project folder should contain all c source files and a correctly configured Makefile.  The commands "make clean" and "make run" should build a .gba file and run your project.

Running your GBA file with either VisualBoyAdvanced or Boycott will show you a single pixel, lit in the center of the screen.

You may now install an IDE for GBA projects.  We officially support (and highly encourage) Sublime Text.
