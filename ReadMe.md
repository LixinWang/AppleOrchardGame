 This is a game where the player must catch apples with a basket to make
 apple pies.
 
** FOR INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS, READ GBA-Setup-Instructions.txt

================================= HOW TO PLAY =================================

 - Press the left and right keys to move the basket.
 - In order to score points, the player must press [A] to empty the basket
 of apples. The more apples in the basket, the more points they will get.
 - When the basket is full (contains 5 apples), the player will not be able to
 catch any more apples.
 - If the player has a full basket of apples, he/she can empty the basket to
 make a pie and get bonus points.

  		0 apples = 0 pts
 		1 apple = 2 pts
 		2 apples = 4 pts
 		3 apples = 8 pts
 		4 apples = 16 pts
 		5 apples (full basket) = 50 pts!!

 - If the player catches a rotten apple in the basket, the whole basket will be
 "spoiled" and automatically emptied, awarding no points. The player will also
 lose a life each time a rotten apple is caught.
 - Apples will fall progressively faster and faster as the game goes on!

 - ** CHEAT: (Only once per game) Press the UP button 5 times during the
   game to get an extra life!
